# nnTrainFlow
demo of workflows for rapid NN training using remote data center AI systems.

Two applications are included:

**[BraggNN](https://github.com/lzhengchun/nnTrainFlow/tree/main/BraggNN)** based on experimental data and 

**[CookieNetAE](https://github.com/lzhengchun/nnTrainFlow/tree/main/CookieNetAE)** using data generated from simulation. 

**Note that**:
These two flows run in production across restricted machines.
As the endpoint, flow and funcX functions used in this repo are private to author's account, one should not expect to run the flows directly from another account. Instead, reader can use these demo flows as template to recreate the flow for other application scenarios.
